              <p class="text-start">I am a photographer with a passion for capturing life's precious moments. My father was a second-generation printer, so I grew up immersed in the world of graphics and print. This exposure ignited my love of photography, and I began taking my own photographs while working as a graphic designer at Utah State University.</p>

              <p class="text-start">As a graphic designer, I used stock photography that sometimes didn't meet my standards. So, I decided to take matters into my own hands and started taking my own photographs. It was during this time that I discovered my love of photography and realized that I had a talent for it.</p>
                
              <p class="text-start">I transitioned into wedding photography when a friend asked me to do a wedding by saying “We aren’t going to hire another photographer, so it’s either you or no one. I figured that I was better than having no photographer, and that same friend hired me for another daughter's wedding. Word of mouth quickly spread, and soon, I found myself in demand for weddings and other family events.</p>
                
              <p class="text-start">However, it was the birth of my own children that really ignited my passion for photography, especially newborn photography. I soon became a specialist in capturing all the milestones of a baby's first year, from maternity photos to birth stories and everything in between.</p>
                
              <p class="text-start">I am also a photographer and area coordinator for the Now I Lay Me Down To Sleep organization, which provides the gift of remembrance photography for families who are suffering the loss of a baby. This work is incredibly meaningful and important to me, and I believe it is the best thing I can do with my camera.</p>
              
              <p class="text-start">People often wonder about the name of my company, Two Color Photography. It's a play on words based on my first and last name, both of which are colors. My first name, Amber, is a warm, golden hue, while my last name, Rust, is a reddish-brown color. Together, they make a unique and memorable name for my photography business.</p>

              <p class="text-start">Overall, my journey to becoming a photographer is a testament to the power of following your passions and using your skills to make a difference in the world.</p>
